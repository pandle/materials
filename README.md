# Materials

Code, guidelines, and much more. Here you can find the link of each repository maintained and the relative [readthedocs link](https://readthedocs.org/profiles/bilardi/).
Collaborations for improving the basic code is much appreciated.

Each repository is based on a [simple git guideline](https://github.com/bilardi/see-git-steps) step by step:
- the main steps are marked with `step [0-9]*` in the git commit description
- and if you download the script [see-git-steps](https://github.com/bilardi/see-git-steps)
- you can follow the development of a project step by step

Each repository contains a real example with:
- installation
- unit tests, continuous integration, deployment or development
- and the working code

## Prototypes

In the [prototypes](prototypes.md) file you find a list of repositories:
each repository is in a different programming language
and it contains the basic fundamental how to start a new repository

- installation
- unit tests (a basic version of Test-driven Development, [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))
- and the code

## Saving packages

In the [saving](saving.md) file you find a list of repositories:
each repository is for a different cloud provider
and it contains a real Python package for managing the saving on that provider

- installation
- unit tests
- and the code

## CI/CD

In the [CI/CD](cicd.md) file you find a list of repositories:
each repository is for a different cloud provider
and it contains a real Python package for deploying a simple pipeline

- installation
- unit tests
- and the code for deploying a pipeline (a basic version of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery / Deployment, [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD))

## Tool comparisons

In the [comparisons](comparisons.md) file you find a list of repositories:
each repository is for a different cloud provider
and it contains the basic fundamental how to deploy some objects on that provider

- installation
- deploy
- and comparison with the other tools
