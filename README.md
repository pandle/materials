# Materials

Code, guidelines, and much more.
Collaborations for improving the basic code is much appreciated.

## Prototypes

In the [prototypes](prototypes.md) file you find a list of repositories.
Each repository is in a different programming language and it contains the basic fundamental how to start a new repository:
- installation
- unit tests (a basic version of Test-driven Development, [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development))
- and the code

## Delicious APIs

In the [deliciousAPIs](deliciousAPIs.md) file you find another list of repositories.
Each repository is in a different programming language and it contains the basic API to connect to [Delicious](https://del.icio.us/rss).

Each repository is based on the relative prototype and it is developed with a [simple guideline](https://github.com/bilardi/see-git-steps) step by step:
- the main steps are marked with `step [0-9]*` in the git commit description
- and if you download the script [see-git-steps](https://github.com/bilardi/see-git-steps)
- you can follow the development of a simple project step by step

So each Delicious APIs repository contains a real example of the relative prototype repository with:
- installation
- unit tests
- and the working code

## Why

It is important to share our knowledge because it is the better way to improve ourselves.
And these materials can be a starting point for any educational course.
